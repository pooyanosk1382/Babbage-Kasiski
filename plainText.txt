One of the most important new features for this edition is the use of Sage for cryptographic
examples and homework assignments. Sage is an open-source, multiplatform, freeware pack-
age that implements a very powerful, flexible, and easily learned mathematics and computer
algebra system. Unlike competing systems (such as Mathematica, Maple, and MATLAB),
there are no licensing agreements or fees involved. Thus, Sage can be made available on
computers and networks at school, and students can individually download the software to
their own personal computers for use at home. Another advantage of using Sage is that
students learn a powerful, flexible tool that can be used for virtually any mathematical
application, not just cryptography.
The use of Sage can make a significant difference to the teaching of the mathematics
of cryptographic algorithms. This book provides a large number of examples of the use of
Sage covering many cryptographic concepts in Appendix B.
Appendix C lists exercises in each of these topic areas to enable the student to gain
hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms. This appendix is available to instruc-
tors at the IRC for this book. Appendix C includes a section on how to download and get
started with Sage, a section on programming with Sage, and includes exercises that can be
assigned to students in the following categories:
