# Babbage-Kasiski

# What is Vigenere encryption?
The Vigenere cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of poly alphabetic substitution.

# What is Babbage-Kasiski test?
The Kasiski test was described by Friedrich Kasiski in 1863; however, it was apparently discovered earlier, around 1854, by Charles Babbage. The Kasiski examination involves looking for strings of characters that are repeated in the ciphertext. The strings should be three characters long or more for the examination to be successful. Then, the distances between consecutive occurrences of the strings are likely to be multiples of the length of the keyword.
